        "description": "Imported from the Decent Visualizer, hence some temperature references may not map to Meticulous capabilities. Produced a complex espresso meant for sipping, not for mixing with milk. The low starting temperature of 82C -- which declines to 72C -- is the magic. This creates a silky, textured shot with good aroma, pleasant acidity, great complexity, and no off flavors. There are two styles: a ristretto or a double shot. With a ristretto, put the recommended dose weight (ie, 14g, 15g, 18g, 20g) into the basket, and pull it as a 1:1 ratio shot. For a double shot, updose by 10% to 20% and extract to a 1:2 ratio (and grind a bit coarser). With both approaches, immediately after preinfusion aim for a flow rate in the range of 0.5-1.2ml/sec. The darker the roast, the slower the recommended flow rate. The ristretto has more flavor and complexity while the overdosed double shot is very smooth, easy to drink, and classic.\n\nDownloaded from Visualizer",
